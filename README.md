# HousePrices_Kaggle
My solution to the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" kaggle competition

In this code I used LGBMRegressor, feature engineering and pipeline to reach Score 0.13178. By now, 1104 in the leaderboard. Maybe later I will try to reach a better score, but by now is good enough I believe. In a real world Score 0.13178 would be a very good score.
